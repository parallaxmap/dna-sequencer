# DNA Sequencer
![](media/header.png)
A flexible MIDI sequencer powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (RP2350), inspired by sequencers found in the Korg Volca and Elektron boxes. Aims to be accessible, affordable, repurposable, and expandable.

## Current features
- RPi Pico 2 microcontroller, the brains of the sequencer
- MIDI output via 3.5mm TRS
- 16 keys for step editing, note input, or other custom macros
- 6 keys for navigation (get ready to menu dive!)
- 8 incremental encoders for CC/parameter adjustment and macros
- 128x64 1.3" OLED display
- All components are through-hole for easy soldering, and readily available

## Why'd you make this?
Currently the options for standalone hardware MIDI sequencers are either budget sequencers that do not have a vast featureset and, at least to myself, were limiting in terms of potential creativity, or more feature rich sequencers which cost a couple arms and legs. I wanted to make a device that would help bridge the gap between those two mountains and leverage the power of DIY & open source in order to create an accessible, affordable, repurposable, and expandable hardware sequencer. Additionally, this project serves as my first 100% serious hardware project, so all of the processes I learn throughout the journey of creating this device will be invaluable to me and whatever future endeavours lie before me... learning is fun!

Choice of keycaps is up to you, as long as they're compatible with Cherry MX. You will also need a Micro USB cable for power and USB MIDI, and a 3.5 TRS to DIN converter for regular MIDI
