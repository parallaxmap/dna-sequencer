## 10/29/2025 - Project goals & concept sketch  

Not really sure how to introduce this first section, so I'll just lay down the goals that I've given myself for this project:
- Create an affordable MIDI sequencer which doesn't skimp on features
- Easy to build, customize, and repurpose if necessary
- Improve on my ability to build, prototype, ship, and iterate on a project
- Get a deeper understanding of MIDI and how it is implemented

For the sequencer's features, after spending some time looking at the features that other synthesizers/sequencers provide and plucking the ideas that I liked the most (whilst also being wary of both computational limits and potential cost savings), I came up with this feature set:
- 8 polyphonic tracks with different modes to facilitate various types of sequencing (e.g drum, chord, arp, euclidian, etc etc), can be assigned to any 16 MIDI channels
- 64 step sequencer with the ability to sequence 8 CC parameters, variable length, microtiming, and randomization/generation features
- 8 parameter macros for performance
- 16 patterns with chaining
- MIDI USB/TRS out

Finally, here's an initial sketch of the design I had in mind for the sequencer:

## 10/30/2025 - Creating initial schematic  

I have completed the majority of the schematic for the main PCB, the only part I have left is to figure out what display module I would like to use and get a KiCad footprint/symbol for it.

Along the way, I had to learn how to create a key/button matrix, how to implement MIDI output electrically, and how to connect a large amount of digital inputs into a microcontroller using an I/O expander, using a lot of intense internet searching, and occasionally asking a few buddies that know more than I do for directions. :)

It was time consuming... but was worth it for the knowledge gained and the satisfaction of a finished task! (for now...)

## 10/31/2025 - PCB routing, revised schematics and decoration  

I spent about 8 hours all together (re)routing the PCB, finding the appropriate footprints and models for components, and re-configuring the schematics in order to facilitate a more efficient PCB design. Here are some images of the final result, I'm quite proud of it personally...

It's intended to be used as a bare PCB (ideally with standoffs), but there are mounting holes that could potentially be used to mount it within an enclosure if you so wish. A good chunk of those 8 hours were spent on 2 previous PCB designs that were abandoned due to the routing being, for lack of a better word, terrible... third time's the charm, as they say :)

Most of the components used here should be able to easily obtained as they are very common electronic components, but I'll have to double check that when it comes to creating the BOM.

After I completed the main PCB rotuing/design, I moved onto adding some small decorations and labels across the design to make it pop out a bit! Although, I was already so exhausted after 3 attempts of routing that I wasn't too tempted to try something extravagant yet...
