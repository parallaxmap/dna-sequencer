## 10/29/2025 - Project goals & concept sketch  

Not really sure how to introduce this first section, so I'll just lay down the goals that I've given myself for this project:
- Create an affordable MIDI sequencer which doesn't skimp on features
- Easy to build, customize, and repurpose if necessary
- Improve on my ability to build, prototype, ship, and iterate on a project
- Get a deeper understanding of MIDI and how it is implemented

For the sequencer's features, after spending some time looking at the features that other synthesizers/sequencers provide and plucking the ideas that I liked the most (whilst also being wary of both computational limits and potential cost savings), I came up with this feature set:
- 8 polyphonic tracks with different modes to facilitate various types of sequencing (e.g drum, chord, arp, euclidian, etc etc), can be assigned to any 16 MIDI channels
- 64 step sequencer with the ability to sequence 8 CC parameters, variable length, microtiming, and randomization/generation features
- 8 parameter macros for performance
- 16 patterns with chaining
- MIDI USB/TRS out

Finally, here's an initial sketch of the design I had in mind for the sequencer:

## 10/30/2025 - Creating initial schematic  

I have completed the majority of the schematic for the main PCB, the only part I have left is to figure out what display module I would like to use and get a KiCad footprint/symbol for it.

Along the way, I had to learn how to create a key/button matrix, how to implement MIDI output electrically, and how to connect a large amount of digital inputs into a microcontroller using an I/O expander, using a lot of intense internet searching, and occasionally asking a few buddies that know more than I do for directions. :)

It was time consuming... but was worth it for the knowledge gained and the satisfaction of a finished task! (for now...)

## 10/31/2025 - PCB routing, revised schematics and decoration  

I spent about 8 hours all together (re)routing the PCB, finding the appropriate footprints and models for components, and re-configuring the schematics in order to facilitate a more efficient PCB design. Here are some images of the final result, I'm quite proud of it personally...

It's intended to be used as a bare PCB (ideally with standoffs), but there are mounting holes that could potentially be used to mount it within an enclosure if you so wish. A good chunk of those 8 hours were spent on 2 previous PCB designs that were abandoned due to the routing being, for lack of a better word, terrible... third time's the charm, as they say :)

Most of the components used here should be able to easily obtained as they are very common electronic components, but I'll have to double check that when it comes to creating the BOM.

After I completed the main PCB rotuing/design, I moved onto adding some small decorations and labels across the design to make it pop out a bit! Although, I was already so exhausted after 3 attempts of routing that I wasn't too tempted to try something extravagant yet...  

## 11/1/2025 12 AM - SMD to Through hole components  

Converted all the previously SMD components on my PCB to through hole components, as this would give me more time to spend actually building the project, gathering tickets, and reduce costs & complexity as I wouldn't (or anybody else building this project) have to do SMD soldering by hand or get PCBA!

## 11/1/2025 3 AM - Creating parts list/BOM  

I spent a couple hours looking at all the components I have been using on my PCB and compiling them all into a BOM. All parts are sourced from DigiKey, except for the OLED display module + MIDI DIN/TRS converter and Micro USB connector neccecary for testing, which was sourced from AliExpress as these are significantly cheaper over there and/or cannot be ordered from DigiKey.

## 11/1/2025 3 PM - Creating Gerbers & models, and tidying up the repository  

Coming up to the final stretch of tasks before getting ready to ship, so far today I have spent the time learning how to create Gerber files from KiCad for fabrication, as well as the .wrl model required by the guidelines. To test to make sure that my Gerber files were all correct and ready to be shipped, I dragged it into JLCPCB, and it all seems to have loaded in correctly (thankfully!)

Additionally, I spent some time writing some more details about the project in the README, as well as adding pictures of the PCB, schematic, and a nice 3D render from KiCad as the header image. I had to spend some time to figure out how to convert my BOM to a Markdown table, and eventually found [a website](https://tabletomarkdown.com/convert-spreadsheet-to-markdown/) that allows me to convert my original LibreOffice Calc file (there is still a BOM.csv within the repository) into a formatted Markdown table.  

## 11/2/2025 - Final task! (for now)  

The initial test firmware is completed! I spent some time researching how to program the Pico for the parts that I have on the board, initially I tried using regular MicroPython and implementing a lot of the stuff manually, but abandoned that idea after some time as I knew it would take way too long than neccecary (and i was sure there was an easier way...)

Eventually, I stumbled upon CircuitPython, which is an alternative to MicroPython that provided a lot of convenience tools like key matrix input, a library for the type of display i am using, etc etc...

The final code (this is not the entire code in the picture) should, if everything is correct, allow you to play a scale of notes on the 16 step keys, display information about what key is pressed and the note being output on the display, and output those notes via the TRS jack!  

## 11/3/2025 - ...nevermind! PCB visual overhaul  

Ended up having some issues that I am currently in the process of resolving regarding verification for submission (shoutouts, they've been very quick to respond and helpful :]), so I decided to at least spend that extra time doing some final touch ups to the look of the PCB, since my initial design was admittedly quite rushed and I didn't feel it fit the "vibe" I was going for. really proud of this!

## 11/4/2025 - Uploaded new assets, gerbers and models based on new design  

The GitHub page should be fully ready now! I'm confident that I've covered all bases, and I spent some time re-exporting some things and creating new graphics to ensure that the repository is fully up to date and ready to ship. Let's just hope it's smooth sailing from here! :)
