## 10/29/2025 - Project goals & concept sketch  

Not really sure how to introduce this first section, so I'll just lay down the goals that I've given myself for this project:
- Create an affordable MIDI sequencer which doesn't skimp on features
- Easy to build, customize, and repurpose if necessary
- Improve on my ability to build, prototype, ship, and iterate on a project
- Get a deeper understanding of MIDI and how it is implemented

For the sequencer's features, after spending some time looking at the features that other synthesizers/sequencers provide and plucking the ideas that I liked the most (whilst also being wary of both computational limits and potential cost savings), I came up with this feature set:
- 8 polyphonic tracks with different modes to facilitate various types of sequencing (e.g drum, chord, arp, euclidian, etc etc), can be assigned to any 16 MIDI channels
- 64 step sequencer with the ability to sequence 4 CC parameters, variable length, microtiming, and randomization/generation features
- 4 parameter macros for performance
- 16 patterns with chaining
- MIDI USB/TRS out

Finally, here's an initial sketch of the design I had in mind for the sequencer:
